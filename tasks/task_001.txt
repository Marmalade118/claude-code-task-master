# Task ID: 1
# Title: Next.js Foundation Setup with Database and Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js 14+ project with App Router, configure Supabase database, set up Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui components, and implement NextAuth with 2FA for admin access
# Details:
Create Next.js project with TypeScript, install dependencies (React 18+, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, NextAuth, Supabase client, Framer Motion, React Hook Form). Configure Supabase database with tables: users (id, email, role, twoFactorEnabled, createdAt), content_pages (id, slug, title, content, seoScore, metaDescription, updatedAt), reservations (id, name, email, phone, serviceType, preferredDate, partySize, message, sourceLocation, createdAt), form_fields (id, fieldName, fieldType, required, options, order). Set up NextAuth with Supabase adapter, implement 2FA using time-based OTP. Configure environment variables for database URL, NextAuth secret, and admin credentials. Set up Netlify deployment configuration with build settings.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for database connection and user authentication flows. Integration tests for NextAuth setup with 2FA. End-to-end tests for admin login process. Database migration tests to ensure schema integrity.
